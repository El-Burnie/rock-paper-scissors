This is a project from The Odin Project to make an in-console rock paper scissors game.

The game will consist of five rounds of rock paper scissors with a human player against the computer.
Each round the user will be prompted to write their choice on a popup. The computer will randomly generate 
a choice of either rock, paper or scissors. After five rounds, the number of rounds won will be compared
and a winner will be declared.
