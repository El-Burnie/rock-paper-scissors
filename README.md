This is a project from The Odin Project to make an in-console rock paper scissors game.

The game will consist of several rounds of rock paper scissors where a human player goes against the computer. The computer will randomly generate a choice of either rock, paper or scissors. The human player will click a button to make their choice. After the max games won (5 by default) is reached by the human player or computer, a winner will be declared.
